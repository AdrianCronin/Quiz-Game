* I built this to bring together all the skills I've gained so far (HTML, Javascript, and CSS) into one project.

* I learned a lot in this project. I learned how to use multiple Javascript and HTML files in conjunction with each other. I learned how to make the application take user input in a variety of ways: text forms, buttons, ect, then save that data to local storage so it can be accessed after the browser closes or navigates to another page. I also gained much more understanding when it comes to generating HTML with Javascript
